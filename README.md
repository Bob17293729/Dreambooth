# Dreambooth Project

In this project, we implement [Dreambooth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12242), a powerful training methodology that retains the distinctive features of a particular subject. By fine-tuning on just a few images of a subject with a unique identifier, the model can generate novel images while maintaining key characteristics across different scenes and settings. 

For more details, check out our report! 

Our finetuned model(of our cute Muse cat!) can be found on [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/sd-dreambooth-library/musecat-ppt-model)
