# Dreambooth Project
In this project, we implement [Dreambooth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12242), which is a powerful training methodology that can retain the distinctive features of a particular
subject. By finetuning on only several images of a subject with a unique identifier, model can generate novel images of the subject, maintaining their key characteristics across different scenes and settings. More details can be found in our report! <br>
This project uses some training code from [Diffusers](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/v0.30.3/en/training/dreambooth#dreambooth)<br>
