# Dreambooth Project

In this project, we implement [Dreambooth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12242), a powerful training methodology that retains the distinctive features of a particular subject. By fine-tuning on just a few images of a subject with a unique identifier, the model can generate novel images while maintaining key characteristics across different scenes and settings.
